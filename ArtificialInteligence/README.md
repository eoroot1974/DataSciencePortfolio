# Artificial Intelligence Projects

Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence section of my Data Science portfolio. This folder contains various projects related to artificial intelligence, including neural networks, reinforcement learning, and other AI techniques.

## Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves the development of algorithms and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. In this section, you'll find projects that showcase different AI methodologies, such as:

- **Neural Networks**: Techniques involving deep learning models that mimic the human brain's network of neurons.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Techniques where agents learn to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards.
