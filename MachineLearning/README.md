# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the Machine Learning section of my Data Science portfolio. This folder contains various projects related to machine learning, including both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data. In this section, you'll find projects that showcase different ML methodologies, such as:

- **Supervised Learning**: Techniques where the model is trained on labeled data, which means that each training example is paired with an output label.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Techniques where the model is trained on unlabeled data, allowing it to identify patterns and relationships without predefined labels.
