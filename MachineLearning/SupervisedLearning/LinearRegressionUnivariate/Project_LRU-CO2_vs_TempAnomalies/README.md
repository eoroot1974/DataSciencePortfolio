# Univariate Linear Regression Analysis: CO₂ Emissions vs Temperature Anomalies

## Overview

A brief introduction to the univariate linear regression analysis of the relationship between global CO₂ emissions and global temperature anomalies.

## Variables

- **Year**: The year of observation.
- **CO2Emissions**: Global CO₂ emissions in million metric tons (Mt).
- **TempAnomaly**: Global temperature anomaly in degrees Celsius (°C).

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Summary

- Loading the dataset.
- Obtaining summary statistics.
- Checking for missing values.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualization of CO₂ emissions over time.
- Visualization of temperature anomalies over time.
- Scatter plot of CO₂ emissions vs temperature anomalies.

### 3. Data Distribution Checks

- Distribution of CO₂ emissions.
- Distribution of temperature anomalies.

### 4. Correlation Analysis

- Correlation matrix.
- Heatmap of the correlation matrix.

### 5. Linear Regression Preparation

- Preparing and splitting the data.
- Fitting the univariate linear regression model.
- Predicting and evaluating the model.

### 6. Diagnostic Checks

- Residuals vs predicted values plot.
- Histogram of residuals.
- Q-Q plot of residuals.
- Durbin-Watson statistic for autocorrelation.

## Conclusion

A summary of findings from the univariate linear regression analysis, including insights on model performance and the validity of assumptions.
