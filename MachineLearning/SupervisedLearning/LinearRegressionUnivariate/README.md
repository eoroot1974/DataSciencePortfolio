# Univariate Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and analyses of univariate linear regression models. Univariate linear regression is a statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable. This repository provides code and examples to help understand and apply univariate linear regression in various scenarios.

## Contents

### 1. Introduction

- Explanation of univariate linear regression.
- Use cases and applications of the technique.

### 2. Dataset

- Information on the dataset used for examples.
- Details about the features and target variable.

### 3. Analysis Steps

#### 3.1 Data Preparation

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Handling missing values and scaling features.

#### 3.2 Model Training

- Fitting the univariate linear regression model to the training data.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as RÂ² score and mean squared error.

#### 3.3 Visualization

- Visualizing the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.
- Plotting the regression line and residuals.

#### 3.4 Diagnostic Checks

- Checking assumptions of linear regression:
  - **Linearity**: Ensuring a linear relationship between variables.
  - **Independence**: Checking for independence of residuals.
  - **Homoscedasticity**: Verifying constant variance of residuals.
  - **Normality of Residuals**: Assessing if residuals are normally distributed.
- Performing residual analysis, including residual plots, histograms, and Q-Q plots.
