# Supervised Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and analyses of various supervised learning algorithms. Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data, and the goal is to predict outcomes for new, unseen data. This repository covers algorithms for both classification and regression tasks.

## Installation and Usage
