# Supervised Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and analyses of various supervised learning algorithms. Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data, and the goal is to predict outcomes for new, unseen data. This repository covers algorithms for both classification and regression tasks.

## Algorithms Covered

### 1. Classification Algorithms

- **Logistic Regression**: A regression model used for binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification by finding the most common class among the nearest neighbors.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.

### 2. Regression Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: A method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Ridge Regression**: A variant of linear regression that includes L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Lasso Regression**: Similar to ridge regression but uses L1 regularization to enforce sparsity.
- **Decision Tree Regression**: A tree-based model for predicting continuous values.
- **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve regression performance.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Preparation

- Loading and preprocessing datasets.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Handling missing values and scaling features.

### 2. Model Training

- Training various supervised learning models on the prepared data.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### 3. Model Evaluation

- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall for classification; mean squared error, RÂ² for regression).
- Cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

### 4. Model Interpretation

- Analyzing feature importance and model coefficients.
- Understanding decision boundaries and predictions.
