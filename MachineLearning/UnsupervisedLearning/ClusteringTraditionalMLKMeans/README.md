# Machine Learning Traditional KMeans Clustering

## Contents  
Project #1: **Project_ULC-RFMCustomerClustering**  
This project applies **unsupervised clustering (KMeans)** to identify distinct customer segments based on their transactional behavior using **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** metrics. The pipeline includes outlier treatment, scaling, evaluation of clustering configurations (K=3 and K=4), and business interpretation of the resulting segments.
