# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and analyses of various unsupervised learning algorithms. Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach where models are trained on unlabeled data to uncover hidden patterns or structures within it. This repository focuses on clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, such as KMeans, to segment data based on inherent similarities without predefined labels, enabling insights in areas like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
